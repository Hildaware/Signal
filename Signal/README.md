## TODO
- How should widgets be shown?
    - Based on a hierarchy of a pre-determined set of rules?
        - How?
            - EVENT
                - IE: JOINED_QUEUE event >> In Queue widget
                    - LEFT_QUEUE >> Remove widget
            - 
        - Rules
            - In Mythic > Timer
            - In Queue > Queue Time
            - Under Level 70 > EXP
            - In the World > Location
